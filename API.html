            <p>
                This is documentation for API v2. Please refer here for Sandbox API v1 documentation.
                
                Mailtrap API is based on the REST principles. The following documentation covers core resources that are used to manipulate the main entities. To start using the Mailtrap API, only a Mailtrap account is required. You have to be authenticated and call the simple HTTPS request on the URL specified below. Please read these basic instructions before you start working with the API.
                
                We offer the following SDKs to integrate Mailtrap API in your application:
                
                NodeJS SDK
                Ruby SDK
                PHP [coming soon]
                Python [coming soon].</p>
            <h4 id="simple-list-item-2">There are several ways to send authenticated HTTP requests:</h4>
            <p>
                Send a HTTP header Api-Token: {api_token}, where {api_token} is your API token
                Send a HTTP header Authorization: Bearer #{token}, where {api_token} is your API token (more info: Token Access Authentication)
                You can manage your API token on the API Tokens page. API token does not have an expiration date, you may reset it manually.</p>
