API V2 is outUse API V2 for your new integrationsAPI V1 would be eventually deprecated (no specific date as for October 13, 2022)Mailtrap API is based on the REST principles. The following documentation covers core resources that are used to manipulate the main entities. To start using the Mailtrap API, only a Mailtrap account is required. You have to be authenticated and call the simple HTTPS request on the URL specified below. Please read these basic instructions before you start working with the API.There are several ways to send authenticated HTTP requests:Send a HTTP header Api-Token: {api_token}, where {api_token} is your API tokenSend a parameter api_token={api_token}, where {api_token} is your API tokenSend a HTTP header Authorization: Token token={api_token}, where {api_token} is your API token (more info: Token Access Authentication)Send a HTTP header Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}, where {jwt_token} is your JWT token (more info: JSON Web Token (JWT))You can find your API/JWT token on your profile page or on the API page in the Mailtrap web application. Both tokens do not have expiration date. You may reset them manually.Allowed HTTPs requests include:POST - to create a resourcePATCH - to update a resourceGET - to get a resource or a list of resourcesDELETE - to delete a resourceHere is the description of common server responses:200 OK - the request was successful (some API calls may return 201 instead).201 Created - the request was successful and a resource was created.204 No Content - the request was successful but there is no representation to return (i.e. the response is empty).400 Bad Request - the request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.401 Unauthorized - authentication failed or user doesn't have permissions for requested operation.403 Forbidden - access denied.404 Not Found - resource was not found.405 Method Not Allowed - requested method is not supported for resource.406 Not Acceptable - the target resource does not have a current representation that would be acceptable to the user agent, according to the proactive negotiation header fields received in the request.409 Conflict - request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.422 Unprocessable Entity - requested data contain invalid values.429 Too Many Requests - exceeded Mailtrap API limits.
